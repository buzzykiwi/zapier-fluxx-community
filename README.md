  Zapier Connector for Fluxx™, Community Edition 
  <br>
  <br>
</h1>

> Fluxx Community Edition (FCE) is a Zapier integration that allows Zapier to connect to your [Fluxx](https://www.fluxx.io) installation, and integrate Fluxx with any of the hundreds of other web applications to which Zapier can connect.

> FCE is third-party, open source software. As it is not provided or endorsed by Fluxx, the Zapier integration is a Private rather than Public integration. i.e. you will not find FCE in Zapier's standard list of integrations. To use it, use the links in Quick Start, below.


### Public vs Private Zapier Integrations

Zapier has two levels of integrations/apps. Public integrations are "first-class citizens": the integrations go through a rigorous assessment by Zapier staff and are then listed and available for all Zapier users. In order for an integration to go public, it has to be developed by the owner of the API (Fluxx) or an authorised contractor. Third-party developers cannot make their integrations Public in this way, but they may make their Private integration available via invite or by invitation link (see Quick Start below).


### Use of This Software

FCE is provided free of charge. You may use it in three ways:

* The most up-to-date version of the software is available within Zapier once you have used the invitation link (see above).
* Developers may wish to download the source from Github, make modifications, and use it as a private integration. See the Zapier CLI documentation for how to set up a developer environment for a custom integration.
* You may use the software in any other way consistent with the MIT licence.

### Quick Start

* INVITATION LINK: Click [here](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/171896/79f0f6177294d5882a4e1eb79aa80fef/) to gain permanent access to FCE for your Zapier login.

### Documentation

### Support

* Please don't contact Fluxx Support for help using this software. Fluxx didn't create it.
* Because this is a Private Integration, Zapier Support can provide only limited assistance. Of course, if your Zap interfaces with other, public applications, Zapier support will be happy to assist.
